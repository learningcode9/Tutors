                Berklee College Of Music. At Berklee I studied a mixture of Performance, 
                Songwriting and Music Business and took many other classes, 
                such as: Ear Training & Sight Singing, Counterpoint, Conducting, Music History, 
                Arrangement, etc. I also took part in songwriting and multiple music business clubs

                <p id="more">I have studied music theory, sight singing/reading and voice at both 
                    Berklee College Of Music and University of Massachusetts Boston. At UMass I 
                    received a classical training, whereas at Berklee I received a contemporary 
                    music education in those fields. Throughout my college years I have always excelled 
                    in my music theory courses and have been asked to help my peers by tutoring them in 
                    subjects such as music theory, solfege, counterpoint and have also offered voice 
                    lessons and beginning keyboard skills. I used to hold weekly meetings with my peers 
                    where I would help them with anything they didn't understand that was taught the
                     previous week. Music is a different language so a good tutor is very important!
                    The way I approach tutoring is seeing where the students' level is and breaking 
                    down the information, so they can understand it and going through that information 
                    as much as they need. I have a lot of theory, solfege, voice lesson and beginning piano 
                    books that are very helpful as well. Throughout my own studies I have found multiple ways 
                    to make music theory concepts more memorable and I love sharing those with students. 
                    I have tutored mainly peers and adults but also love teaching children. I believe that 
                    learning music is a wonderful thing, so I want to help you learn the theory behind your 
                    favorite song, and help you find your voice while encouraging a fun learning environment.
